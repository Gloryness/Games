## Guessing Game

I first got the idea to do this in a computer science lesson when I was asked to make a Random Number generator and you had to guess the number.

I thought it would be cool to well... expand it a little. So I did (at home obviously). I made a menu which has 2 games to play: 
- **Guess The Number**
- **Guess The Function**

Guess the number is pretty self explanatory, whereas guess the function is a game where you have an input such as a string, list, tuple, int or float and that is then put in the parameters of a random built-in function. 

For example: `[1, 2, 3] ---------> [3, 2, 1]` - you would probably think of a built-in function that can convert the input to the output. The correct answer would be `reversed`.
