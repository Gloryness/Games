## Music Game

### About
Initially, this was a project I was tasked with (out of 3) in a computer science lesson and I thought this would be the most fun to create because although the instructions were pretty basic, one of them was "Store a list of song names and artists in an external file" and I instantly new what I was going to do. Instead of hardcoding each song and artist I will instead dynamically create the list by using spotify's API and getting the top 10 tracks for some popular well known artists. (I originally got the top 25 songs monthly, but literally 90% of the artists I had no clue they existed).

### Requirements
Required external modules that are installable using pip:
